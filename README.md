# Ray Tracer in Java

* Current version: 0.2

## Introduction

This is a simple ray tracer implemented in Java 8, followed the instructions from the book *Ray Tracer from the Ground Up*. The original code was C++. To practice my Java skill I choose to translate and improve the original one. In fact, Java is not a good choice for this task, for the sake of efficiency and elegance (Java do not support operator overloading hence it's super ugly to implement a Math library in Java).
